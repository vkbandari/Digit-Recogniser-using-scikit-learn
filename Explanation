The source data is downloaded from kaggle.
It consist of 42,000 records of data.
So I used first 21,000 data records to train the decision classification tree.
Next 21,000 to predict the model and stored the values of predicted data in a list.
After that I displayed a random record in test data using matplotlib as 28 * 28 matrix.
Then I printed the  output/label by passing the same record as index in list  which I got from model.

-- thank you...
